  <h2>📍 Here's the basic principle of Feng Shui 📍 </h2>
</div>

<h3>In Asian culture, this philosophy is called the Tao, which translates to mean “the way." Taoism is the way of nature, and all the basic rules of Feng Shui reflect nature. Here's a look at the essential principles of Fengshui: <b>the commanding position</b>,<b> the Bagua</b>, and <b>the five elements</b>.

            <h3>A bagua is the Feng Shui energy map superimposed on the floor plan of your home. The Chinese word "bagua" translates to mean “eight areas.” Each of the eight areas relates to a different life circumstance: family, wealth, health, helpful people, children, knowledge, fame, partnerships, and career. 
                <p>
                    And each of these areas has corresponding shapes, colors, seasons, number, and earthly elements. At the center of the bagua—a ninth area—is <b>you</b>, <b>representing your overall wellness</b>.

    <h3>
        If you'd like to Feng Shui your home, first you need to know about the commanding position. In Feng Shui, the commanding position is the spot in a room that is the farthest from the door and not in direct line with it. 
        <p>It puts you diagonal to the door. And ideally, you should have a clear line of sight to the door. The commanding position is where you want to <b>spend most of your time in a room</b>.</p>

        The Five Elements
        </h2>
</div>
<h3>
    The five elements of Feng Shui—earth, metal, water, wood, and fire—come from the Taoist tradition. The elements are five interrelated phases in life that work together to create a <b>complete system</b>. Typically, when you Feng Shui your home, you balance these five elements.
